- 👋 Hi, I’m Albert Traut alias @AlTrAugsburg
- 👀 I’m interested in coding crazy ideas, that take too much of my spare time
- 💻 My knowledge:
  - Java and JavaFX(only 2D)
  - PHP, CSS, JS
  - Electron
- 🌱 I’m currently studying Verwaltungsinformatik at the HföD and Hochschule Hof
- 📝 Projects I worked on:
  - virtual-machine-Assembler: A small Electron programm for everyone who wants to learn the basics of Assembler like languages
  - Dimension-Collapse: This was planed to be game, but it was discontinued in the first month, because of lack of communication
  - [VInf Grade](https://altraugsburg.github.io/VInf-Grade): A simple webtool for VInf students at HföD Bavaria to calculate their grade (currently in Beta)
- 🤫 Right now I'm working on a game with my own little game engine (if you can call it that) completly coded in Java
- 📫 How to reach me: vma@ladon.xyz (Mailadress of the virtual-machine-Assembler Project)
