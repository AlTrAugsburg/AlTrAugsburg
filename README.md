- 👋 Hi, I’m Albert Traut alias @AlTrAugsburg
- 👀 I’m interested in coding crazy ideas, that take too much of my spare time
- 💻 My knowledge:
  - Java
  - PHP, CSS, JS
  - Electron
  - ForgeRock AM (AM410)
- 🌱 I studied Verwaltungsinformatik at the HföD and Hochschule Hof
- 🏢 Right now I'm working for the Bavarian goverment in the IT
- 📝 Projects I worked on:
  - virtual-machine-Assembler: A small Electron programm for everyone who wants to learn the basics of Assembler like languages
  - Dimension-Collapse: This was planed to be game, but it was discontinued in the first month, because of lack of communication
  - VInf Grade: A simple webtool for VInf students at HföD Bavaria to calculate their grade, development discontinued
- ✨ What's next for me? Time will tell...
